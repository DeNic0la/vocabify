# Setup

To setup this project simply follow this guide. I Highly recommend doing this on a Linux machine.

## Step 1
Clone The Project and open it in your IDE(A).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DeNic0la/vocabify.git && cd vocabify
```

## Step 2
There is a script for the setup if you are using Linux. For the setup with linux read the [Script Tutorial](script.md). Else follow those steps.
