## How to play

We are currently hosting a instance of the application on [the web](https://vocabify-3d855.web.app/). You might get some errors (saying the site is insecure)those sometimes appear when hosting on Firebase.

## Setup

Are you a developer and want to host/setup this application yourself?
[Click here for information about the setup](setup/Readme.md).
The setup for the deployment is simple, if you have some basic web development and some Firebase knowledge.
We do not provide help with setting up the github workflows.
